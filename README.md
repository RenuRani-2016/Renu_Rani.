About My self

Hi, I’m Renu Rani – a Data Analyst and Demand Planner with a passion for turning data into stories that drive better decisions. Over the years, I’ve worked with tools like SQL, Excel, Power BI, Python, and Tableau to explore data, build clear visualizations, and apply statistical analysis and predictive modeling.I enjoy solving problems, whether it’s optimizing demand planning, improving operational efficiency, or uncovering insights that support business growth. My goal is always to make data approachable, actionable, and aligned with real business needs.

Outside of projects, I’m someone who’s curious and continuously learning, always looking for ways to grow my skills and apply them in meaningful ways.
